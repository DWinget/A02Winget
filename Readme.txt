I started with a template from Initializr.
I used the https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ website to get a description of each HTML tag used and see an example of its use.
I used the https://www.w3schools.com/css/ website to get a description of each CSS selector used and see an example of its use.
I used the bootstrapious.com website for a contact form template (https://bootstrapious.com/p/how-to-build-a-working-bootstrap-contact-form).
I took the .clearfix and *boxsizing code lines from the https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp website to help align my elements correctly.
I used the M04 assignment as a starting template for the Javascript files.
The valid number check in function calculateDigit (located in Math_trick.js) came from the slides in U03.
I used the template from the M03 assignment for the Qunit test.
The introductory video was an assignment I completed for course 62522.
