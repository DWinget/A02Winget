					<hr>
					<h2 class="subtitle">Background</h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> I was born in Texarkana, Texas and currently live in Oregon, Missouri. I am married and have two sons, ages 8 and 9. I retired from the Army in 2014 after 20 years of service as an Engineer Officer, including multiple deployments and overseas tours. I spent 3 years serving as Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil & Mechanical Engineering at the United States Military Academy (USMA). I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering from USMA, a M.S. in Engineering Management from the University of Missouri at Rolla, and a M.S. in Structural Engineering from the University of Texas. I am also a registered Professional Engineer in Missouri and Texas, and a licensed secondary education math teacher in Missouri.</p>
					<h2 class="subtitle">Plans for the Future</h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> I am in my second year of the M.S in Education program at Northwest Missouri State University. Upon graduation, I plan to start teaching high school math. Teaching at the high school level will allow me to impact students at a younger age while providing time over the summer to spend with the family. </p>
					<h2 class="subtitle">Interests</h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> My hobbies include hunting, fishing, snorkeling, reading, economic research, games with the family, gardening, and woodworking. Technology specific interests include electronics and computer hardware repair and construction, and learning more about website development and programming applications to assist in effectively using technology to improve learning inside and outside of my classroom.</p>
